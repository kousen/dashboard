For the project, imagine you have been tasked with building a product dashboard that your company will use internally. There are a few requirements:

- Create a RESTful API service to add, update, and retrieve product information
- Uses Hibernate to interact with a SQL database
- Utilizes Angular on the front-end 

Each product is an record with the following columns:
- id: unique identifier
- name
- category: ID relating to category table
- full_price: up to two places of decimal
- sale_price: up to two places of decimal
- availability: boolean value stating is the product is in stock (true) or not (false)
- supplier?: related table?

The MVP will be able to :
- Perform basic CRUD functions
- Return a list of products by category
- Return a list of products by category and availability
- Sort products by full price, sale price, and the percentage of discount

---


At the end of the project, you should have two parts: first, a Java Spring Boot application handling your RESTful API and second, a simple front-end application that interacts and displays the data from your API.
